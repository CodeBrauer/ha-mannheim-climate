# Klimamessnetz Mannheim

Home Assistant integration for the dense urban climate network of
[Smart City Mannheim](https://smartmannheim.de/) (400+ stations). It provides climate values
for a location of your choice: temperature, humidity, dew point, absolute humidity, apparent
temperature, air pressure, global irradiance and wind.

The integration picks the station that represents your place best. If the nearest one does
not fit (too far away, different surroundings, mounted on a roof), it combines several
stations around you instead.

## Features

- **Location on a map**, pre-filled with your Home Assistant home location.
- **Station recommendation** based on distance, surroundings (Local Climate Zones) and
  mounting height; accept it with one click or choose yourself.
- **Interactive station map** that only allows as many stations as fit the API budget and
  shows the resulting update interval live.
- **One station or a combination**: the median of several stations, outliers removed.
- **Sensors and a weather entity** with all current values, plus diagnostic sensors.
- **Respects the API limits** with a shared request budget and cache for all locations.
- **Several locations** (home, work, ...), each as its own device.
- **Repairs** when a selected station stops delivering data or disappears, and
  **suggestions** when new stations are added nearby.
- English and German.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    API[(Klima API<br>api.smartmannheim.de)]
    Hub[Hub<br>request budget, cache,<br>station list]
    C1[Location 1<br>stations + combination]
    C2[Location 2<br>stations + combination]
    E1[Sensors and<br>weather entity]
    E2[Sensors and<br>weather entity]
    API -->|station list, daily| Hub
    API -->|measurements| Hub
    Hub --> C1 --> E1
    Hub --> C2 --> E2
```

All locations share one hub that talks to the API, so a station used by two locations is
fetched once and the requests of all locations together stay within the API limit. Each
location polls its stations and combines their latest values into one set of entities.
